    <p> I am currently a student in Moringa school doing there first module in Software Development. I do consider
        myself being a forever student eager to build my academic foundations in Information Technology(IT) and Software
        Development and also stay in tune with the latest technological advancements. I began my studies in Lang'ata
        west primary school, proceeded to Ofafa Jericho Highschool, then to Strathmore University, finishing off with a
        Degree in BBIT in Jkuat. I have worked before in Bluewave International as a programmer after which i started my
