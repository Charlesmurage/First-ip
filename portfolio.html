        <h2> Charles Maina Murage</h2>
        <p> I am currently a student in Moringa school doing there first module in Software Development. I do consider
            myself being a forever student eager to build my academic foundations in Information Technology(IT) and
            Software
            Development and also stay in tune with the latest technological advancements. I began my studies in Lang'ata
            west primary school, proceeded to Ofafa Jericho Highschool, then to Strathmore University, finishing off
            with a
            Degree in BBIT in Jkuat. I have worked before in Bluewave International as a programmer after which i
            started my
            own company called Masai Hatcheries.</p>

    <div class="column">
        <p><span class="bold"> Why i chose the path to programming?</span></p>
        <p> I decided to take this class on programming because i was always fascinated by how programs in the computer
            and phones worked, and once i got a taste of it during my attachment i never looked back.</p>
